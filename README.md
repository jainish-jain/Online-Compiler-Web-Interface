## INTRODUCION
### Overview
<p>
Online compiler web interface is a web interface for compilation of programming
languages (mainly C, C++, Java, Python2, and Python3). This is very handy web
application for coders who loves coding on IDE (Integrated Development
Environment)but faces unexpected crashes and tricky bugs in their code.
 <ul>
<li>Works on intranet server, so internet connectivity isn’t important but needed to
connect with server computer.
<li> Fast compilation, easy to use.
 </ul>
 </p>

### Problem Statement
<p>
Develop a web application which facilitates compilation of programming languages
without having a need to install any System software/application compilers or any IDE
(Integrated Development Environment). Also web application which facilitates file
management system so that users can have a platform to save their work progress.
The following problems are arising:
 <ul>
<li> Faculties aren’t able to check program individually of every student in class.
<li> Due to Internet connectivity problems online compiler sites couldn’t run.
<li> Slow compilation on some online compiler websites like jDoodle, Paiza.io, etc.
<li> Needs to install compilers (and associated applications) of different programming
languages (like JDK, Python, Turbo c7,etc.) separately to every computer system.
<li> Students aren’t able to store all programs they ever made permanently for future
use because of computers in college used by many peoples and files get lost most
of the time.
<li> Some students use application software like turbo c7 they works on very old
compiler versions, some use online compiler sites which mostly have newer
versions.
 </ul>
